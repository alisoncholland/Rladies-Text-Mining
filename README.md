# ${1:Rladies-Text-Mining}

## This is the code I presented at the Rladies meet-up in Berlin on 19th March 2019 at WATTx Office. 
## You can find out more about the event here: https://www.meetup.com/de-DE/rladies-berlin/events/258925980/

## This Text Mining code looks at the relationships between words by conducting frequency and sentiment analyses. 

## All the code I use can be found in the Text Mining with R book, which can be found here: https://www.tidytextmining.com/

# Installation

## I used the free statistical software programme R (https://www.r-project.org/) to write and analyse my data. Once R is up and running, install and load the following CRAN packages:

## - dplyr
## - tidytext
## - janeaustenr
## - tidyr
## - igraph
## - ggraph

# Usage

## Feel free to use whatever code you like. All I kindly ask in return is that you cite it appropriately :)
